# MPMB-Adjustments
These files are custom scripts used in my campaign. The base scripts were created for v12.96 and need to be updated to 13.x

Notes:
File [-2018 Custom Code Adjusted] is the main work that I need help with adjusting.
 - According to the information that Joost has provided, lines 1-150 should not need any adjustment.
 - Lines 150-245 is the major part of the script that needs to be updated to work with v13.x
 - I belive that Lines 252-276 may need to be updated to work properly, as well.\
 
 I will be reviewing all assistance given in the hopes of learning a thing or three, as well.
 Thank you, everyone, who are at least looking at this personal project.

Talent Trees and Talent Trees 2 are one document that have been split for import.
